    "The notebook also contains formative assignments. These are indicated as FA-n, where n is a number id. As explained on the course guide, you have to submit these. Please submit your best effort (*i.e.*, FA-n questions with no answer will be considered incomplete), and **if your solution does not work or you think it is inadequate, add a comment explaining why you could not proceed further**.\n",

It's not a problem if you upload the notebook with additional code, like the variants and tests mentioned above. However, to grade your assignments, we will only look at the answers to the requested exercises (those indicated with FA-n), so **make sure you store your answers in the corresponding variables and/or to name your functions as indicated**.\n",

These are exercises that suggest you to create an alternative approach, or which propose a longer problem that allows for the integration of earlier concepts in one solution; in general, they present scenarios where you can be more creative. To make the most of the course, it is best to try them out and share your solutions on the Discussion Board, so that your peers can comment on them. You are also encouraged to comment on the exercises of your fellow students. This will help you sharpen your evaluation skills, which is a great asset in programming, as in turn this will help you devise more robust, efficient and maintainable solutions. \n",
