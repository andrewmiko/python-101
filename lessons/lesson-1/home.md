### Assignment 1: Exploring Variables and Data Types
**Objective:** To understand and implement the basic concepts of variables and data types in Python.

**Task 1:** Create a Python script that:
1. Declares and assigns values to the following variables:
   - A string variable named `name` with the value "John Doe".
   - An integer variable named `age` with the value 30.
   - A floating-point variable named `height` with the value 5.9.
   - A boolean variable named `is_student` with the value False.

**Task 2:** Perform the following operations and print the results:
1. Convert the string variable `name` to uppercase and print it.
2. Convert the integer variable `age` to a string and concatenate it with the string " years old".
3. Convert the floating-point variable `height` to an integer and print the result.
4. Use the boolean variable `is_student` in a logical operation to print the opposite value.

**Task 3:** Write comments in your code explaining each step.

### Assignment 2: Working with Operators and Type Casting
**Objective:** To apply arithmetic, logical, and comparison operators, and practice type casting in Python.

**Task 1:** Create a Python script that:
1. Declares two integer variables `a` and `b` with values 12 and 8, respectively.

**Task 2:** Perform the following operations and print the results:
1. Arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and exponentiation.
2. Logical operations using two boolean variables `x` and `y` with values True and False, respectively.
3. Comparison operations between the variables `a` and `b`.

**Task 3:** Implement type casting:
1. Convert a string "50" to an integer and print the result.
2. Convert an integer 50 to a float and print the result.
3. Convert a boolean True to an integer and print the result.

**Task 4:** Write comments in your code explaining each step.
