Task 8: Working with the Random Module

Objective: Demonstrate proficiency in using the random module in Python.

Problem:
Write a Python program that performs the following operations using the random module:

    1.	Generate a list of 10 random integers between 1 and 100.
    2.	Randomly shuffle the list.
    3.	Select a random element from the shuffled list.
    4.	Generate a random float number between 0 and 1.
    5.	Simulate rolling a six-sided die 10 times and store the results in a list.

Expected Output:

    •	The list of 10 random integers.
    •	The shuffled list.
    •	The randomly selected element from the shuffled list.
    •	The random float number.
    •	The list of results from rolling a six-sided die 10 times.
