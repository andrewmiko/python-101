Task 3: Maps and Filters

Objective: Demonstrate proficiency in using map and filter functions in Python.

Problem:
Write a Python program that performs the following operations:

    1.	Create a list of integers from 1 to 10.
    2.	Use the `map` function to create a new list where each element is the square of the corresponding element in the original list.
    3.	Use the `filter` function to create a new list from the squared list that contains only even numbers.
    4.	Combine the results to print both the squared list and the filtered list.

Expected Output:

    â€¢	The list of squares.
    â€¢	The filtered list of even squares.

Filtered list (even squares): [4, 16, 36, 64, 100]
