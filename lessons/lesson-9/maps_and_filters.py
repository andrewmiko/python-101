Task 3: Maps and Filters

Objective: Demonstrate proficiency in using map and filter functions in Python.

Problem:
Write a Python program that performs the following operations:

    1.	Create a list of integers from 1 to 10.
    2.	Use the map function to create a new list where each element is the square of the corresponding element in the original list.
    3.	Use the filter function to create a new list from the squared list that contains only even numbers.
    4.	Combine the results to print both the squared list and the filtered list.

Expected Output:

    •	The list of squares.
    •	The filtered list of even squares.

Original list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Squared list: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
Filtered list (even squares): [4, 16, 36, 64, 100]
