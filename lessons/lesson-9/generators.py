Task 4: Generators

Objective: Demonstrate proficiency in creating and using generators in Python.

Problem:
Write a Python program that includes a generator function to produce an infinite sequence of random numbers between 0 and 9. Use this generator to count how many times each number appears in the 1,000,000 generated numbers and print the results in a dictionary.

Expected Output:

    â€¢	The statistics for 10 numbers from 0 to 9 in dict each on a new line.

---
0: 60455
1: 42398
2: 2163
...

dict => unique keys => only one time in dict
dict => not unique values => key: value -> Any value (type)
